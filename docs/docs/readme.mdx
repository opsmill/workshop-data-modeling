title: AC4 WS:C2 - Data Modeling & Network Source of Truth
---

This workshop provides an introduction to data management and network modeling in a SOT, a crucial part of any automation stack.

## Requirements

Please bring a laptop with Python installed and make sure to have a valid account on Github.com.

Ensure that your laptop is configured with the appropriate permissions to install and run software.

- Python (version 3.10 or above)
- Python venv: To avoid messing up your local Python setup, you should be able to create a virtual Python environment or work in a dedicated container/VM.
- Unix: It is recommended that you work on a Unix-based operating system like Linux or MacOS, or WSL on Windows.
- IDE: You can use the IDE you desire. If you don’t have a preference, our recommendation is to use VS Code.
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
  - Alternatively you can install the [SQLite Viewer plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer&ssr=false#overview)
