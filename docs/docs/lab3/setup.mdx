## Requirements

In order to complete this lab, it's required to have:

- An instance of Infrahub 1.5.x up and running
  - Details have been emailed to Autocon4 workshop attendees
- A Web browser with internet access
- The cli tool `infrahubctl` to communicate with Infrahub

## Access your instance of Infrahub

A dedicated instance of Infrahub has been provisioned for each student registered for the workshop.
The information to access your instance are available in OpsMill's cloud portal.

Each student should have received an email with a `login`/`password` to connect to the portal.

:::info
If you haven't received this email please reach out to the staff for help

<ReferenceLink title="OpsMill Cloud Portal" url="https://portal.opsmill.cloud/" openInNewTab />
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Once logged into the Portal, you can access the information about your instance by navigating to it:

- Organization `Org <your email address>`
  - Environment `AutoCon Workshop`
    - Instance `Workshop Infrahub`

## Accounts to connect with infrahub

The Infrahub instance has been provisioned with 2 accounts

- login `student` | password `autocon2`
- login `admin` | password `infrahub`

It's recommended to use the `student` account for the rest of the workshop

:::info
The `student` account isn't authorized to make changes to the default branch, all changes must be done in a branch and they can be integrated into the main branch via a Proposed Change
:::

## Install and Setup `infrahubctl`

`infrahubctl` is a cli tool designed to help interact with a remote instance of infrahub, it's meant to run on any server or laptop.

It's typically used to:

- Load new schemas
- Manage branches (create, delete)
- Help with local development and testing of Artifact, Transform, Generator and Check

### Validating that `infrahubctl` is correctly installed

`infrahubctl` is already installed as part of the main python environment provided for the workshop so it should be already installed.

Run the following command to validate that it's correctly installed:

```shell
infrahubctl --help
```

### Install `infrahubctl`

:::info
If `infrahubctl` is already installed on your system you can go directly to the next section
:::

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pip" default>
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

```shell
pip install 'infrahub-sdk[ctl]'
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Poetry">
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

```shell
poetry add infrahub-sdk --extra ctl
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup `infrahubctl`

`infrahubctl` needs to be configured with the address of the infrahub server and an API token with the right permissions

The easier way to configure `infrahubctl` is to define some environment variables.

```shell
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS=<url of the server available in the portal>
export INFRAHUB_USERNAME=admin
export INFRAHUB_PASSWORD=infrahub
```

:::info
`infrahubctl` (and the Python SDK) also support an API Token based authentication in addition to username/password, but this method won't be covered in this workshop.
