title: Add Role to Interface
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import ReferenceLink from "../../src/components/Card";

The initial schema is capturing some technical information about devices, interfaces and IP addresses, but to distinguish between a Loopback interface and a physical interface we need to rely on the name of the interface.

## Add a Role to the interface model

In the file `workshop_b2/lab3/schemas/dcim.yml` uncomment the section highlighted below that is be currently commented

```yaml  {25-31}
  - name: InterfaceL3
    namespace: Dcim
    description: Network Layer 3 Interface
    label: Interface L3
    icon: mdi:ethernet
    menu_placement: DcimInterface
    display_label: "{{ name__value }}"
    order_by:
      - name__value
    inherit_from:
      - DcimInterface
      - DcimEndpoint
    attributes:
      - name: status
        kind: Dropdown
        optional: true
        choices:
          - name: active
            description: Fully operational and currently in service.
            color: "#7fbf7f"
          - name: maintenance
            description: Undergoing routine maintenance or repairs.
            color: "#ffd27f"
      - name: role
        kind: Dropdown
        optional: true
        choices:
          - name: loopback
          - name: uplink
          - name: peer
    relationships:
      - name: ip_addresses
        peer: IpamIPAddress
        optional: true
        cardinality: many
```

## Load the updated schema

```shell
infrahubctl schema load workshop_b2/lab3/schemas --branch schema01
```

After reloading the frontend (reload your browser tab), in the Interface L3 view, you should now see a column called `Role`.

## Load some additional data

In the file `workshop_b2/lab3/data/interface_l3.yml`, first uncomment the lines that are defining the role of each interface and reload the data in to Infrahub with the following command:

```shell
infrahubctl object load workshop_b2/lab3/data/interface_l3.yml --branch schema01
```

:::info
This command is idempotent because the schema defines a Human Friendly ID for each interface based on the name of the related device and the name of the interface itself.
